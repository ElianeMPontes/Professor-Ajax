    Like a river, like a river, sh-<br>
    Like a river, like a river, sh-<br>
    Like a river, like a river<br>
    Shut your mouth and run me like a river<br>
    <br>
    How do you fall in love?<br>
    Harder than a bullet could hit you<br>
    How do we fall apart?<br>
    Faster than a hairpin trigger<br>
    <br>
    Don't you say, don't you say it<br>
    Don't say, don't you say it<br>
    One breath, it'll just break it
    So shut your mouth and run me like a river<br>
    <br>
    Shut your mouth, baby, stand and deliver<br>
    Holy hands, will they make me a sinner?<br>
    Like a river, like a river<br>
    Shut your mouth and run me like a river<br>
    Choke this love 'til the veins start to shiver<br>
    One last breath 'til the tears start to wither<br>
    Like a river, like a river<br>
    Shut your mouth and run me like a river<br>
    <br>
    Tales of an endless heart<br>
    Cursed is the fool who's willing<br>
    Can't change the way we are<br>
    One kiss away from killing<br>
    <br>
    Don't you say, don't you say it<br>
    Don't say, don't you say it<br>
    One breath, it'll just break it<br>
    So shut your mouth and run me like a river<br>
    <br>
    Shut your mouth, baby, stand and deliver<br>
    Holy hands, will they make me a sinner?<br>
    Like a river, like a river<br>
    Shut your mouth and run me like a river<br>
    Choke this love 'til the veins start to shiver<br>
    One last breath 'til the tears start to wither<br>
    Like a river, like a river<br>
    <br>
    Like a river, like a river, sh-<br>
    Like a river, like a river, sh-<br>
    Like a river, like a river<br>
    Shut your mouth and run me like a river<br>
    Hey! Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh!<br>
    Hey! Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh! (like a river)<br>
    Hey! Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh!<br>
    Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! (like a river)<br>
    Like a river<br>
    <br>
    Shut your mouth, baby, stand and deliver (like a river, like a river)<br>
    Holy hands, will they make me a sinner? (like a river, like a river)<br>
    Like a river, like a river<br>
    Shut your mouth and run me like a river<br>
    Choke this love 'til the veins start to shiver (like a river, like a river)<br>
    One last breath 'til the tears start to wither (like a river, like a river)<br>
    Like a river, like a river<br>
    Shut your mouth and run me like a river<br>

    <br>
    After the VMA's my baby momma cussed my ass out<br>
    I kicked her ass, we back friends like Puffy and Steve Stoute<br>
    Cut the grass around my clique so I could see these snakes<br>
    You see 'em back in the hood, it's cause I see they're fake<br>
    I preach a sermon 'bout the paper like I'm Creflo Dollar<br>
    I pop you punk niggas like I pop my collar<br>
    I'm confused, I like Megan, Monica and Mya<br>
    Missy's freaky and Brandy's shy, uh<br>
    Now take a look at how my lifestyle changed up<br>
    I'm on now, God damnit, I done came up<br>
    Now you can find me with the finest hoes<br>
    Choosin' which whip to drive by what match my clothes<br>
    I got a fetish for the stones, I'm heavy on the ice man<br>
    If I ain't got a pistol on me, sure I got a knife fam<br>
    Get out of line and I'm lightin' yo' ass up<br>
    Semi-automatic's spray I tighten yo' ass up – what?<br>
    <br>
    Every hood we go through<br>
    All the gangsters around know my whole crew (Nigga what?)<br>
    We hold it down like we 'sposed to (Haha)<br>

    Slow down little nigga, don't exceed your speed<br>
    Cause I will put G's on your fitted like the Negro League<br>
    I got connects, I don't need no weed<br>
    I been in L.A. for a year now, so I don't see no seeds<br>
    After I'm done you: clappin' the crew<br>
    Hell yeah I fuck fans, guess what, your favorite rapper does too<br>
    In a minute I'ma have the jeweler makin' my rims spin<br>
    My crew run wild like the Jamaicans in Kingston<br>
    Nuttin' but bling bling in your face boy; that's why my neck<br>
    Shine like one of the shirts that Puffy and Mase wore<br>
    I done found a nympho as soon as I pop a bra<br>
    She at my balls, head first like a soccer star<br>
    You can only stand next to the man if you proper<br>
    I take care of birds like an animal doctor<br>
    I been out and buzzin', niggas just slept on me<br>
    So I'm out for revenge like one of Bin Laden cousins<br>
    <br>
    Every hood we go through<br>
    All the gangsters around know my whole crew (Nigga what?)<br>
    We hold it down like we 'sposed to (Haha)<br>

    Read the paper, look at the news, we on the front page<br>
    Yeah we in the Bahamas with AK's on the stage<br>
    The ice in the Jacob watch'll make a broke nigga take somethin'<br>
    So I gotta keep the fo'-fifth with no safety button<br>
    G-Unit get that money, I know some artists is starvin'<br>
    But play the game like they rich, to me the shit funny<br>
    I know you see me comin'; cause on the front of the Maybach<br>
    It say payback for those that hated on me<br>
    I hate when niggas claim they bangin' a gang<br>
    You ain't a Crip like Snoop, you ain't a Blood like Game<br>
    See I been havin' beef, I got my own bulletproof vest<br>
    Most of my enemies dead, I got about two left<br>
    Until my last breath, I'm sendin' niggas bullet holes<br>
    Innocent bystanders get hit tryna be heroes<br>
    You know how we roll, everywhere that we go<br>
    It's Fo-Fo's, Calicos, and Desert Eagles, yeah<br>
